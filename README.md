# Off-by-One Error in Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the off-by-one error.  The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to iterate through an array but uses an incorrect loop condition, causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version.

This is a classic example of a subtle bug that can be easily missed during initial development. This example highlights the importance of carefully checking loop bounds when working with arrays or other collections.
